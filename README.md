# Security Capabilities (SC) / Security as a Service (SecaaS)

This is the official PALANTIR repository where the Security Capabilities functionality, configuration, descriptors, and interfaces are allocated.

## Structure definition

The repository contains different information related with SCs:

- [Descriptor packages](https://gitlab.com/palantir-project/sc-secaas/-/tree/master/descriptor-packages): it contains the files required for the on-boarding and instantiating in the Security Capabilities Orchestrator (SCO).
- [SCs](https://gitlab.com/palantir-project/sc-secaas/-/tree/master/SCs): it includes the configurations, images and relevant files to deploy such SC.
- [UseCase1](https://gitlab.com/palantir-project/sc-secaas/-/tree/master/UseCase1/Y1-Scenario): These folders incorporate the demos designed to demonstrate the functioning of the different SCs deployed for the Use Case 1. Besides, a folder appears inside of it for the year of creation.

## User Guide
Into the specific SC folder, the necessary commands for a proper deployment are explained, as well as possible configuration files created to produce a successful installation and integration.
