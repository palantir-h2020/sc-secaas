    A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows you to traverse untrusted 
    networks as if you were on a private network. It gives you the 
    freedom to access the internet safely and securely from your 
    smartphone or laptop when connected to an untrusted network, like 
    the WiFi at a hotel or coffee shop.
